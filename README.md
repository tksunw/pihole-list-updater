# pihole-list-updater
Powershell scripts to manage Pi-Hole's block and allow lists using public curated sources

### build-allowlist.ps1
* processes community allowlist(s) and outputs formats for use with pi-hole or unbound	

### build-blocklist.ps1
* processes community blocklist(s) and outputs formats for use with pi-hole or unbound	

## To-Do:
* have the scripts directly update gravitydb rather than the older text file style of blocklist/allowlist
